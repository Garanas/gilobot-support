Description['uab1301'] = "The Quantum Reactor produces the energy needed to support Quantum Gates and T3 factories. Construction of structures next to a Quantum Reactor greatly improves the operating efficiency of the adjacent structures."

Description['uab1301b'] = "A single T4 Quantum Reactor produces enough energy to run a base at the top of the tech tree.  Constructing structures next to it will give huge efficiency benefits.  Because of the immense scale of its power, if it explodes, you will lose any nearby units as well."


Description['ueb1301'] = "The Fusion Reactor Array produces the energy needed to support Quantum Gates and T3 factories. Construction of structures next to a Fusion Array greatly improves the operating efficiency of the adjacent structures."

Description['uec1901b'] = "A single T4 Fusion Reactor produces enough energy to run a base at the top of the tech tree.  Constructing structures next to it will give huge efficiency benefits.  Because of the immense scale of its power, if it explodes, the result is as devastating as a nuclear weapon."


Description['urb1301'] = "The Ion Reactor produces the energy needed to support Quantum Gates and T3 factories. Construction of structures next to an Ion Reactor greatly improves the operating efficiency of the adjacent structures."

Description['urb1201b'] = "A single T4 Ion Reactor produces enough energy to run a base at the top of the tech tree.  Constructing structures next to it will give huge efficiency benefits.  Because of the immense scale of its power, if it explodes, you will lose any nearby units as well."

Description['urb1301b'] = "A single T4 Ion Reactor can produce enough energy to run a base at the top of the tech tree.  Constructing structures next to it will give huge efficiency benefits.  This version of the Ion Reactor costs more mass and energy to build, but it is also much less volatile."

Description['xsb1301b'] = "A single T4 Quantum Reactor produces enough energy to run a base at the top of the tech tree.  Constructing structures next to it will give huge efficiency benefits.  Because of the immense scale of its power, if it explodes, you will lose any nearby units as well."
