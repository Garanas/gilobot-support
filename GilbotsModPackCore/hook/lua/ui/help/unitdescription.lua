-- Exponential Mass Extractors mod
----------------------------------------
--# Aeon
Description['uab1103'] = "The mass output of this extractor will increase over time as it gets deeper into to the deposit source and becomes more efficient. It can also be upgraded to a more efficient version to speed up this process. If under attack, it can align itself into a defensive position and activate a strong personal shield. While it does this, the mass it extracts will be used to power the shields and none of its output will be available to the rest of the army's economy. The shield gets stronger as the mass extraction rate increases."
Description['uab1202'] = "The mass output of this extractor will increase over time as it gets deeper into to the deposit source and becomes more efficient.

-- Exponential HCPP mod
----------------------------------------
--# Aeon
Description['uab1102'] = "Deposits of hydrocarbon-containing natural resources remain a viable form of energy to this day. The HCPP is much more efficient than a standard Power Generator.  Energy output increases over time as the HCPP optimises its harnessing of the natural resources it is built on. When uder attack, it can divert produced energy towards an intelligent sheilding system.  While the shielding system is in use, the energy output of the HCPP is not available to the rest of the resource grid."
--# UEF
Description['ueb1102'] = "Deposits of hydrocarbon-containing natural resources remain a viable form of Energy to this day. The HCPP is much more efficient than a standard Power Generator.  Energy output increases over time as the HCPP optimises its harnessing of the natural resources it is built on.  The UEF version also has the ability to divert power to its DLS (Damage Limitation System), effectively reducing damage done to it by 75%.  While the DLS is in use, the energy output of the HCPP is not available to the rest of the resource grid."
--# Cybran
Description['urb1102'] = "Deposits of hydrocarbon-containing natural resources remain a viable form of Energy to this day. The HCPP is much more efficient than a standard Power Generator.  Energy output increases over time as the HCPP optimises its harnessing of the natural resources it is built on.  The This model can make use of Cybran stealth and cloak technology to keep its presence unknown while it builds up its power output.  Stealth and cloak field ranges can be extended as more power becomes available."
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
-- Aeon Czar buff mod
----------------------------------------
--# Aeon
Description['uaa0310'] = "This version of the Czar is equipped with a personal shield, but it costs enormous amounts of power to operate.  Like the original version, it has some anti-air measures, but it can still be brought down by a large enough swarm of air superiority fighters. It is particularly vulnerable to SAM launchers, and won't last long with its shields down.  Its depth-charge weapon ensures that it is not totally defenseless against sea units."

Description['uac1401b'] = "Attach this to a network of structures and any shield on the network will have increased resistance to projectiles.  Default increase for direct adjacency is 10%, but that can be increased to 100% using Alt-R to adjust its power.  This consumes more energy."
